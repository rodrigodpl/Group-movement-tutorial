## The problem

When in a videogame a single unit must travel from point A to point B, we should only need a pathfinding algorithm (A\*, djikstra) properly coded to obtain a satisfactory result. That solution is useful, but limited. 

What would happen if we face a situation where a tile that in the moment the unit called the pathfinding method was walkable, but is not anymore where the unit is reaching it?

That could happen if a new building have just been placed in the map, or a troop has moved to a point in the path. The code as it is would let the unit travel across the colliding element as if it just wasn't there.

Now, let's imagine a situation where dozens of units are required to travel to a single point, a likely scenario in any RTS game. The result would be them overlapping one over the other to the point of appear a blurry mass.

That's only a brief example of game-breaking situations that could derive of not having proper code managing the displacement of units: enemies travelling over freshly built walls, confronted armies crossing each other without fighting...

In order of providing a little light over the matter, in the following lines it can be find a simple to use tutorial with code examples and exercises on the topic.
